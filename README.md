# What is Machine Learning?
- Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
- Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.

# What is it used for?
- Fraud detection.
- Web search results.
- Real-time ads on web pages
- Credit scoring and next-best offers.
- Prediction of equipment failures.
- New pricing models.
- Network intrusion detection.
- Predicting Customer Churn
- Pattern and image recognition.
- Email spam filtering.
